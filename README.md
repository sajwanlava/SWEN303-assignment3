# Summary
The Final Project is a group project, where you combine the work from Assignment 1 and 2 and build a testable prototype, conduct user tests and then improve the prototype.
This project will have at least 6 stages:

## Group formation
Evaluation of the 3-6 previous prototypes
Creating a testable prototype
User testing of the prototype
Implementing changes from tester feedback
Documentation and creation of a video

## Group Formation
The groups will be created based on students choosing an area they are interested in (mostly the same as assignment 1&2) and the roles the students want to play in the group, people they want to work with and the option to veto some potential group members.  Google form for group formation voting group preferences. Each group will be given a gitlab.ecs group to work on the final project.  We will form the groups based on the constraints you provide.

## Evaluation of the Prototypes
Each group will have multiple designs related to the same overall project.  In this stage, you will evaluate the designs that have been proposed by the members of the groups. This evaluation will be a heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough or some hybrid to the two which you will document. You will present the results of the evaluation which will guide which features of the original designs you prototype for the User Testing

## Creating a testable prototype
This will be a digital prototype using, at a minimum, clickable areas which transition to different parts of the prototype.  This prototype could have more functionality if you want to include it, however, it is possible to get full marks using a program such as Adobe XD / Balsamic. The prototype will be high enough fidelity for effective user testing.

## User testing of the prototype
In this stage of the project, you will be testing your prototype on members of the class who are not developing an interface for the same area.  Every member of the class must participant in testing other teams projects. You will document your testing methodology including a test plan. You will report the results of the user testing, and summarise the changes needed to reduce the problems or improve the system.

## Implementing changes
User testing will generally find many issues with an interface.  In this stage, you will change and update the prototype with respect to the feedback from users.  These changes need to be documented.  The easiest way to do this is to create issues in gitlab based on the feedback from the testing.  These issue can then be connected to the changes you make in the design and the commits of the updates to address the issue raised.

## Video and Documentation
The last stage is to document the work you have done, and to create a video showing the final version of the prototype. The video will show the main functionality of the interface and try to emphasise the interactions particularly when some of the interactions might be complex or hard to describe in text.

# Submission requirements.
You will be submitting a link to the gitlab.ecs repository for the project and a link to your reflections on the work you contributed to the projects, and what you were responsible for.

## Required content

1. Background to the project. This should be very similar to at least one of the previous projects background.
2. Personas. With a description of how the multiple personas coming into the group were merged to form between 4 and 6 Personas.
3. Scenarios. With a desciption of how the scenarios where merged and decided upon.
4. Designs ideation. This shows the different designs that were created for Assignment 2.
5. Design review. Discusses the evaluation of these designs and pros and cons of each design using an "expert" evaluation techniques of Heuristics or Cognitive walkthrough, or other system that you find and describe.
6. Design prior to user testing.  This is the first full design of the interface for user testing.  With a description similar to assignment 2, but updated to include input from the group.
7. Usability Test plan. This is the plan for how you will test the interface.  This includes:
- Methodology  How many users and what you are testing
- The script - What you say to the users
- Roles - Who is doing what
- Tasks - What are you testing
- Metrics - How you are measuring
- Usability Goals - what is the level you are happy with on the above metrics
- Problem Severity - How bad are the problems
8. Usability Test Results
- The results from the tests, based on metrics, compared to goals and how severe each issue is.
- Issues that will be updated for the second version of the prototype - listed as issues in gitlab. These issues will be associated with group members.
9. Updated Design and Prototype
- The update to the design
- Description and a clear indication of what has changed and why, including links to issues in gitlab raised as part of testing
10. A video showing the final version of the prototype working.
11. Group Reflection
- What is left to be done
- Best and worst parts of the prototype

## Individual Contribution and Reflection
This is where you identify your contribution to the group and reflect on what you learnt. This will include:

### Contribution
This would include:
- Which role(s) you had in the group from the animal avatars
- Your evaluation of your performance in the role
- Evaluation of the other roles, an if the role system was effective
- A description of responsibilities in the development and testing of the prototype
- A link to the list of issues which you were responsible for in Gitlab


### Reflection
- The contribution you are most proud of in the project
- The key things you learnt about User Experience that you will take forward into other projects
- How the group functioned as a whole and how you contributed to functional and/or dysfunctional aspects of the group.
