| Name    | Pros                                                                   | Cons                                                           | How to improve?                                                                                            | What can we bring forward?                                                                              |

| Callum  | Scenarios looked well thought out.                                     | Personas were both male and in similar age group.              | More colour.                                                                                               | A page to find existing study groups.                                                                   |
| Erin    | Discussion of how the specific personas interacted with the webpages.  | Personas came from the same age group and similar background.  | Better layout of webpages.                                                                                 | As questions, and book room were on one webpage area and the buttons were easy to navigate to and see.  |
| Jaimar  | Good range of personas.                                                | Lack of colour on templates of the webpages.                   | Find room by group project was a bit confusing to understand and wasn't really applicable to university.   | Lots of easy to find buttons on the webpages.                                                           |
| Aleisha | Platform webpages were well described.                                 | Personas were both female and in a similar age group.          | Web interface may be better for this software, but I understand the benefits of a mobile app as well.      | Uploading and downloading was an interesting feature.                                                   |

## Priyal
| Name    | Pros                                                                                      | Cons                                                                                                                               | How to improve?                                                                                                                                  | What can we bring forward?                             |

| Callum  | Clear navigation within the application                                                   | Too much information on the first page - a bit overwhelming                                                                        | Introduce a colour scheme                                                                                                                        | Notifications on next study booking and study requests |
| Erin    | Colour scheme is simple and calming, prototype design is clean and efficient (looks good) | Limited tutor functionality - they should have access to all other functionality as well as login and answer questions             | Homepage to do list/diary not necessary - it's an added bonus                                                                                    | Messaging interface (prototype)                        |
| Jaimar  | Straight forward prototypes                                                               | Available room depend on courses and/or group projects                                                                             | Consideration of a colour scheme, add login as it's own use case and remove 'enter login' from all other cases (just assume users are logged in) | Incorporating project management tools (as links?)     |
| Aleisha | Thorough personas, nice overall outlook of prototypes                                     | Can only book a room through a specific course - what about wanting to create a study group with friends who are in another course | more variation in personas                                                                                                                       | File Sharing                                           |
