| Callum  | Clear navigation within the application                                                   | Too much information on the first page - a bit overwhelming                                                                        | Introduce a colour scheme                                                                                                                        | Notifications on next study booking and study requests |
| Erin    | Colour scheme is simple and calming, prototype design is clean and efficient (looks good) | Limited tutor functionality - they should have access to all other functionality as well as login and answer questions             | Homepage to do list/diary not necessary - it's an added bonus                                                                                    | Messaging interface (prototype)                        |
| Jaimar  | Straight forward prototypes                                                               | Available room depend on courses and/or group projects                                                                             | Consideration of a colour scheme, add login as it's own use case and remove 'enter login' from all other cases (just assume users are logged in) | Incorporating project management tools (as links?)     |
| Aleisha | Thorough personas, nice overall outlook of prototypes                                     | Can only book a room through a specific course - what about wanting to create a study group with friends who are in another course | more variation in personas                                                                                                                       | File Sharing                                           |
