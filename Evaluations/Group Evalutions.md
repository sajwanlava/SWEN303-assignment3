| Callum  | Scenarios looked well thought out.                                     | Personas were both male and in similar age group.              | More colour.                                                                                               | A page to find existing study groups.                                                                   |
| Erin    | Discussion of how the specific personas interacted with the webpages.  | Personas came from the same age group and similar background.  | Better layout of webpages.                                                                                 | As questions, and book room were on one webpage area and the buttons were easy to navigate to and see.  |
| Jaimar  | Good range of personas.                                                | Lack of colour on templates of the webpages.                   | Find room by group project was a bit confusing to understand and wasn't really applicable to university.   | Lots of easy to find buttons on the webpages.                                                           |
| Aleisha | Platform webpages were well described.                                 | Personas were both female and in a similar age group.          | Web interface may be better for this software, but I understand the benefits of a mobile app as well.      | Uploading and downloading was an interesting feature.                                                   |
