# Insert Evaluations in here:
Separately upload/link your assignment2 in the wiki. 
Evaluate the assignments (particularly personas, scenarios and screenshots) and answer the following questions for each, based on your observations:
* Pros
* Cons
* How to improve?
* What can we bring forward to our final one?

| | Pros | Cons | How to improve? | What can we bring forward to our final one? |
| Lavanya & Priyal | Lots of graphics, detailed personas | | No way of moderating chat | Lecturer persona, room booking and study partner scenarios, pastel colour scheme |
| Callum | Confirm group requests scenario, calendar main feature, group finder interface | | should calendar be so big? | group finder |
| Erin | Separated way of communicating with tutors so no need for them to be in group chat | No scenario on how to use calendar | Write calendar tasks | Calendar, friend requests |
| Jaimar | Flexibility with order of booking room or creating group | lack of colour | Clarity around processes | Project management tools |
| Aleisha | Available times scenario, moderate chat | Login scenario is too 'important', uses mobile interface | Clarity around available times | Download and upload files, moderate chat |
