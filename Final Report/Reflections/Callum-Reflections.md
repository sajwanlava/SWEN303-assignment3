## Contribution 
I was given the role of the cat (cynic) in the group. My job was to find holes in our ideas and ensure we were setting realistic goals and deadlines that we could hit. I think I did my role well. However, I struggled to keep to my cynic role and was often agreeing with the decisions of the group and not acting as a cynic the entire time. When appropriate I would point out when we could do something different and questioned our milestones in terms of whether they were realistic and we could reach them, however our milestones were almost always reachable so there wasn’t much use to my role keeping everyone grounded in their expectations as we would almost always reach our expectations. 

The group worked well together and there wasn’t anyone who stood out above others in their role, as the way the group functioned, most of the roles crossed over and would do similar things.  

I was the main member of the group to collect and combine each of the parts of the system that other member of the group made to form the overall system. As such I was able to fulfil my role by reviewing what everyone designed and ensure that it was consistent with the overall system, and that the intended navigation and interactions made sense to me. When it did not make sense or something stood out that I believed could be done better, I discussed with the group what could be done to ensure navigation and interactions made sense for the user. When we did out testing, the feedback we received indicated that the navigation and the tasks the user completed made sense for the users and only in a few areas the users had something happen that they did not expect, which from that indicates to me that I performed my role quite well. 

In developing the prototype, I was largely responsible for the event booking pages. These pages were for booking a room, editing a room booking and searching for a group to join. I also contributed varying amounts to many other pages as I volunteered to combine everyone’s parts into the overall system, as such I had input and sometimes made changes to other parts of the system to keep their styles consistent throughout the system and correct any mistakes I spotted when combining.

## Reflection 

The contribution I am most proud of is the combining each part of the system built by others into the one prototype. I volunteered to have everyone send me the work they had done so I could piece it all together. This task took my many hours with each new addition or change to the system made by other’s, I would then wire it into the prototype. This task was at times difficult as the way the parts fitted together wasn’t always clear, and since this was my first time using Adobe XD I was constantly learning new features that I could use to make the prototype work better. I was proud because I was often relied upon to make intended features of the system work properly. 

The key things I will take forward about User Experience is the necessity for user testing. I have learned about user experience before but never the testing side and this course showed me that even while doing my best to consider the needs of the users and their experience with systems, it’s impossible to really know whether a part of the system will make sense to the users without a user testing it, as the different perspective can reveal parts of the system you didn’t consider to be of any confusion to the user. 

The group functioned really well together, however things fell apart for me in the evening where much of the group discussion occurred after 10 pm and often times discussion would go on long after 11pm which due to me trying to sleep, I was no longer able to respond or keep up with discussions, meaning I would miss some issues and my input on other decisions and ideas would be limited.
