## Contribution

I held the Facilitator :rabbit: role in our group. I believe I performed well in this role and did more than my role entailed. However, I did not book our meeting rooms or maintain the issues board on my own, which were possibly responsibilities of my role. 

I felt that the role system wasn't entirely effective for our group. It was good to have a clear product owner/champion :bear: but the role of a leader seemed to have a bit of crossover between multiple roles - leader, facilitator and manager :bear: :rabbit: :wolf:. I also felt like my facilitator role :rabbit: crossed over with the role of the processor :owl:.While everyone contributed and there was no one person who seemed to lag behind or do less, not every animal role was portrayed. 

We stayed on track, met our milestones and are very proud of our end product. I don't think this is because of an effective animal role system, but it was helpful to have a group consisting of some managerial types and some 'worker bee' types, which was maybe indicated when we initially selected the roles we thought we fit into.

My key responsibilities as a facilitator :rabbit: were about ensuring our group could achieve our goals by providing the resources to make that happen. That was mostly in the form of organising our wiki and notes, keeping track of deadlines, answering questions and ensuring I had an understanding of our group's vision. My biggest responsibility was the user testing because it was the biggest part of the assignment and involved a lot of heavy documentation. 

My contributions included: 
* taking notes at meetings and making sure all information was always accessible for everyone via the wiki
* keeping track of what was missing in our project, what our upcoming deadlines were, and ensuring the team had all the resources they needed to complete their tasks
* adding the calendar module to the prototype and other prototype linking and fixing
* conducting usability testing
* writing usability documentation ( [Usability test plan](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen303-2019-p3/t8/final-project/wikis/Testing/Test-plan), [tasks](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen303-2019-p3/t8/final-project/wikis/Testing/Usability-test-tasks), [pre-](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen303-2019-p3/t8/final-project/wikis/Testing/Results/Pre-test-questionnaire) and [post-](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen303-2019-p3/t8/final-project/wikis/Testing/Results/Post-test-questionnaire)test questionnaires, and [final report](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen303-2019-p3/t8/final-project/wikis/Testing/Results/Report) )
* creating the [final prototype demo video](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/swen303-2019-p3/t8/final-project/blob/master/Final%20Report/swen303-final-prototype-demo.mp4)

## Reflection

I am most proud of the usability testing as this was my biggest contribution to the project. I spent many hours on the test plan, running the testing sessions, and writing up the results and final report. Everything was very seamless and smooth, and we were well prepared at the testing. We did our testing well in advance, so we didn't delay completion of our project. I am also very proud of our final prototype, although this wasn't solely my contribution. It is a true combination of all of our prototypes from Assignment 2 and looks like a great application.

The key thing I learned about User Experience that I will take forward into other projects is that testing is so vital because not everyone's experience is the same and we can't design as if everyone has the same experiences and expectations as us. Our initial prototype had interfaces that were familiar to us, developed based on the assumption that everyone would understand why something is where it is or what it means, but they were unfamiliar or didn't make sense to our testers. For example, I'm a fan of interfaces with lots of whitespace and minimal harsh lines. I implemented our calendar system with this in mind - and we received feedback that dividers between the days would be helpful, or that there was too much whitespace. An interface that looked 'clean and simple' for me was possibly unclear and lacked proximity for someone else. The testing was great because it gave us a chance to build a prototype based on real feedback not just assumption, and meant our prototype was genuinely better by the end.

The group functioned well as a whole. There was no one who contributed significantly more or less than anyone else, the tasks were shared well and everyone was fair and understanding of the other responsibilities (assignments, jobs) that members had on their plates. Our group chat was always active. I helped by answering questions so people could complete their own tasks, I wanted to make sure that people were never unclear about our next step or expectation for something.
