# Individual Contribution and Reflection

## Contribution
My role for this group project is the owl. My role is to focus on the required objectives are met. I think I did okay with my role, although I could've been more active and checked the deadlines we made for ourselves.
I found myself asking what should be done, when I should be checking the issues. I felt like I was the 'worker bee', as I was always asking if I could do anything to help out and asking for task to be assigned to me.

I believe that my group members satisfied their roles and that they did very well. Though, we ended up side tracking on our roles. In the end, we were doing a bit of other member's roles. From that, all members contributed pretty evenly and no one was doing less that the other members.
I think that the role system wasn't really effective, due to us fulfilling other member's role.

The responsibilities I had as the processor is making sure that these tasks were being met and I don't believe that I fulfilled my role fully. During development of the prototype, I did quite a bit for chat and reporting users before the testing period, connecting them to where they need to be and fixing errors in terms of the feedback from testing. I was the note taker during the usability test, recording the user's comment and also the path they take when going through the task they needed to complete.

## Reflection
The contribution I'm proud of was being able to actively work on the prototype, but mostly working on connections and errors needed to be fix for the chat and reporting. It took awhile to fix the errors/feedback from user testing, due to me using Adobe XD for the first time.

The key things I learnt about User Experience was how important user testing is. Without it, we wouldn't have found problems about our project even though we've gone through checking if everything works. It's great to get feedback from the user to improve our system and that would be essential for other projects in the future.

I think the group functioned very well, helping other member's when their having trouble with a task or when they have to do other assignments/jobs. We communicated frequently to know what everyone is doing and to let other members know what their doing at the moment.
