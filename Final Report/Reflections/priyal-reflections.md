###INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION AND REFLECTION


##CONTRIBUTION

In this group project I was given the role of the Wolf. The Wolf is the manager; the head of the pack who makes sure everyone is contributing and tells the bear to stop talking, if needed. 

I believe I have played the role of the Wolf competently throughout this group project. I have taken the responsibility of leading and helping to lead in meetings to ensure everyone present participates in the discussions and decisions proposed as well as ensuring everyone’s opinions are heard and accounted for. During this project I have kept notice of members contributions and have not noticed any lack of participation from any member. All members have been actively contributing and communicating throughout the project and offering to do further tasks. I myself think my own contribution to the project was slightly lacking in the first few weeks this was mainly due to my laptop being stolen which caused some stress and temporary resource constraints. I also am not confident using git and have not taken on more of a responsibility to becoming more comfortable using it.  

I do not believe the role system was effective. I was fortunate enough to have members of my group who collectively provided all the traits covered by these roles. We did not closely follow the roles, we always had someone to fulfil the roles however not always by the person who was originally allocated the role. I feel like the roles gave people personalities and traits to follow but in reality some members did not match their roles and therefore were made to feel uncomfortable in certain situations. Throughout the project we allocated jobs by asking what tasks members wanted to do and were comfortable carrying out. 


##EVALUATION OF ROLES

Bear - Lavanya (The Leader The person who likes to lead, has a vision and ideas they want to develop. Usually the loudest in the group)
The Bear in our group was a key member of the group who most definitely was (one of) the loudest in the groups and lead us through this project. Lavanya consistently gave updates on our progress and project status and what needs to be done. She also booked rooms for group meetings and set up most of the pages on git for us to use and add to.

Cat – Callum (The Cynic The person who can find the holes in ideas, and the ways of cheating the system)
It was not apparent to me that the cat found holes in our ideas and ways to cheat the system. As stated above we did not really stick to the roles. Callum did handle most of the initial prototype connecting and prototype updating and perhaps found cheat ways to make things more efficient during these processes.

Puppy – Erin (The Enthusiast Always supports ideas, and wants to help add and develop ideas)
The puppy in our group offered their help and suggestions throughout this project. Particularly towards the end Erin was constantly working on the prototype updating based off our user testing results and running these updates through the rest of the group. 

Owl – Jaimar (The Processor Focuses on making sure that the required objectives are met. Likes to make and complete lists)
The Owl was not evidently ensuring we were meeting the required objectives, they did not bring this up within the group. Jaimar did not make lists as far as I am aware. He was contributing in other aspects throughout this project and was always asking if there was anything more he could do. He participated in the user testing and actively worked on the prototype throughout the project.

Rabbit – Aleisha (The Facilitator Spots when things are missing and volunteers to go and get stuff. Talks to the session organiser)
The rabbit followed their role very accurately. They took the minutes of our meetings which are in the wiki which was very handy to look back on to recall all that was achieved and planned in the meetings. Aleisha consistently communicated with the group throughout the entirety of the project, talking about things we have missed and her voiced her opinion on aspects she saw we could improve and change.

##Issues I was specifically responsible for:

##REFLECTION

I am proud of the overall look of our prototype which was influenced from mine and Lavanya’s group assignment 2 prototype. I have an eye for design which made it easy for me to identify parts of our prototype which could be improved to provide a more smooth finish that is appealing to our users. Even just the small things such as layout, colours and transitions. The aesthetic of our prototype definitely highlights the features of our model and brings out the best in our design which allows for a more satisfying experience with the application. 

One of the key things I have taken away from this assignment is the significance of user testing and how it can notably improve your work. User testing broadens your views on the task at hand and identifies critical problems which you may not have even considered throughout the development process. Since there are many unique potential users for an application, user testing provides the means to aim to producing a more general outcome which will best cater for all types of users with different capabilities. Through user testing I found aspects of the design which were clear to me and that I thought worked well being the complete opposite with the feedback we got from the user testing. 

I feel like the group worked very well together throughout this project. We all maintained communication throughout the project, voicing our opinions, reporting our progress, offering our help and praising one another. We were able to establish, distribute and complete tasks, as well as identify and problem solve issues that did arise. I contributed in meetings where members were very quiet through speaking up and taking lead in directly asking members of their thoughts and needs so that we were avoiding wasting time, getting decisions made and progressing with our project. I identified what needed to be done during meetings and aimed to ensure we would have discussed and resolve all the issues that had been planned for those meetings. I regularly asked questions as to check up on others progress and what tasks still needed to be done and what I could contribute towards.
