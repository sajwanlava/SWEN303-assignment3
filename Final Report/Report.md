## BACKGROUND

## PERSONAS
(Very minor changes throughout by Jaimar and Callum.)

#### Lecturer 

*PROFESSOR FAN YU HONG (BY LAVANYA SAJWAN)*
Fan Yu Hong is a 57-year-old Financial Econometrics lecturer at the VUW Pipitea campus. Outside of her time teaching students, she is a divorced mother of two and likes to spend much time with her children. While she does teach a technical course, she would prefer to use a simple system. As a career and family orientated woman, she would rather her spare time is spent enjoying hobbies. Yu Hong is a person who looks at models and graphs often, so she values an interface that is simple and aesthetic. 

**ACTIVITIES:** Yu Hong spends a lot of time with her kids. In her weeks without them, she enjoys going on long walks and meeting friends for brunch. 

**ATTITUDES:** Fan Yu Hong is a straightforward and blunt individual. However, she always tries to support her students.  

**APTITUDES:** Fan Yu Hong is intelligent and well spoken. She is seen as a good lecturer.  

**WEAKNESSES:** She can be impatient. 

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Prof. Yu Hong has only ever taught at Victoria University. She has been teaching at Victoria University for four years now and has used existing systems, but they are only used in this university so she does not have knowledge on other systems which may be specific to other universities.  

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** The organisation tools she has used have been the room booking systems. She has not used Discord or the ECS forum as they are both more specific for the ECS faculty. Therefore, she does not have a lot of knowledge about the combination study organisation system that we have designed.  

**INTERACTION:** Yu Hong will interact with the study organisation application most often closer to exams or tests when students want extra help sessions. She will also assign tutors for the course that she is lecturing at the beginning of each trimester.

**PRIORITIES:** Fan Yu Hong wants to be certain that students are using this medium of communication wisely, as well as ascertain what they might be confused about in the class content. She also would like to easily book rooms for small help sessions. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** Her only motivation is that it will be easier to book rooms for groups of people that are interested in help sessions.  

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Fan Yu Hong is competent learning new tasks and how to use new systems, but it has to be a quick process otherwise she ignores it till it becomes absolutely necessary to use. 

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Yu Hong has an extremely low risk tolerance - preferring to use systems and features that are tested and fully work, otherwise she gives up. 

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Yu Hong likes to absorb information that is relevant to her own learning. She feels that she does not have time for supplementary learning. 

**TINKERING:** Yu Hong does not like tinkering on programs. She would rather use something that is easy and functional as that does not require much learning.  

#### Tutor

*AUSTIN LOWE (BY PRIYAL PATEL) *
Austin is a student in his third and last year studying towards a Bachelor of Design Innovation majoring in Interaction Design. Austin is looking for additional skills and experience which he can also add to his cv and remembers enjoying creating digital artwork and receiving excellent grades in that course. He will be tutoring first year students enrolled in the creative coding course DSDN142.

Austin will primarily use the system to help him with tutoring. He plans to use it to coordinate with students that want to discuss the course content with him in person and also make himself accessible to anyone that needs his help or wants to ask him questions. 

Austin has other commitments, among them his own study so he likes being able to answer questions posed to him by students through the system at a time of his choosing and on his own terms, so he can construct the appropriate answer to their questions.

**ACTIVITIES:** Austin’s free time is usually spent on his computer at night working on extracurricular digital artwork, playing video games or watching anime. 

**ATTITUDES:** Austin is considerate and encouraging person wishing to inspire others and as a proud designer is dedicated to his work and guiding others.  

**APTITUDES:** He is an intellectual, focused learner with great creative skills who works well under pressure. 

**WEAKNESSES:** He is a shy person at first especially in unfamiliar situations  

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Being a third-year Design student, Austin knows his way around both campuses being familiar however with Te Aro campus more than Kelburn campus. 

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** He is proficient in modern technology use therefore can use nearly all systems without any major trouble. 

**INTERACTION:** He would most likely want to maintain daily interaction with the Study Organiser to check on any of his students’ course related activity as he wants to use the system to ensure his students can progress with their work and aren’t delayed in doing so. However active interaction would probably be a couple times a week used to arrange extra study sessions when additional help is needed.  

**PRIORITIES:** Austin will strive to be there for his students in providing them with answers to the questions they have and providing further information when they encounter difficulties. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** He hopes his passion for design along with the opportunity to tutor first years will boost his confidence and improve his social skills. 

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Austin is an independent person who can perform tasks with limited aid from others. 

**RISK TOLERANCE:** This ability to process information quickly gives him confidence with operating new systems as well as allowing himself to adapt to new environments and easily overcome technical obstacles either on his own, by looking up solutions online or asking one of his friends.  

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** He is a fast learner. 

#### International Student 

*RAHUL MEHTA (BY LAVANYA SAJWAN) *
Rahul is a 34-year-old International Master of Engineering by Thesis student. He has recently moved from India and has not studied in a few years, so it is a bit strange for him to be back at a university. He has been working as a developer in private companies since graduating. Rahul is talkative and is often wanting to immerse himself in new experiences, especially in a new country. He has come here on a scholarship and has moved his wife and child overseas with him. 

Rahul uses the system to become better acquainted with other students and in doing so help familiarise himself with the local terminology and accents.

**ACTIVITIES:** Rahul is still setting up his new rental property and exploring Wellington’s sights with his new family.  

**ATTITUDES:** Rahul is an extremely optimistic individual. He is outgoing and is always willing to learn.  

**APTITUDES:** Rahul is extremely hard working. His drive comes from moving his family halfway across the world so he could further his education despite being considered “well-off” overseas.  

**WEAKNESSES:** While he is fluent in speaking three languages; Punjabi, Hindi and English, he finds it difficult to understand colloquial words and jargon present in the English language, and more notably in the kiwi way of speaking.  

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Rahul has had some experience in the use of a similar system to the study organiser in his old jobs as a way of connecting with people in the workplace and booking rooms for meetings.  

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** At university, he has used Discord, the ECS forum and the library booking system, but not a lot as he is still new. He has not used a system where elements of each are all combined to make our designed product.  

**INTERACTION:** Rahul will often be using the system. He is new and needs to do bridging courses to complete his masters and would really like to meet people in those papers so that he can find study buddies. 

**PRIORITIES:** Rahul wants to easily connect with like-minded people in his courses and book meeting rooms for study sessions. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** Rahul wants to do the best he can in his courses and complete his Masters thesis to the best standard possible.   

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Rahul has been working in the technology sphere since graduation and considers himself a competent user of systems. Coming from a coding background, he does not enjoy badly designed interfaces.  

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Rahul has a medium risk tolerance. He understands that developing a product is hard, but if something has been deployed, it should be expected to work properly. 

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Rahul is more comfortable with theory-based learning, but after an explanation of a system, he would not mind playing around with it. 

**TINKERING:** Rahul does not mind tinkering with a program. He is an inquisitive person so when he gets the initial explanation on how to use something, he will keep on trying every scenario till he reaches all outcomes.  


#### Domestic Student

*Beyoncé (Aleisha)*
Beyoncé is a 21 year old student at Victoria University of Wellington, living in the CBD. She is in a Computer Science Major in her third year. Most of her engineering and computer science courses include group assignments so she uses the Study Organiser app talk to her classmates and find rooms and times to meet with group members.
Her goal is to obtain a B+ average grade across all of her courses. She wants to do well, but she has many other responsibilities and activities to juggle and finds that she struggles to learn the content as quickly as some of her peers. She often uses the app to ask questions about assignments, which usually get answered by a fellow student or tutor.
She likes that she has access to her peers and academic support without them seeing unrelated person content such as her Facebook or Instagram posts. Being a woman in a male-dominated area, she appreciates having a platform away from social media with a university-only context because it sets a standard and expectation of how to interact with each other.

**ACTIVITIES:** Beyoncé spends most of her days at uni in classes or in the library, and if she's not at uni then she's at work. She works part-time at a tech start-up based in the city as a Junior Developer. She doesn't like to do assignments in the evenings because she's normally quite drained by the end of the day, so she likes to relax by watching Netflix or having a drink with friends. Beyoncé also teaches a code club once a week at her primary school.

**ATTITUDES:** Being the busy person that she is, Beyoncé is highly organised. However she is also often stressed and feels a lot of pressure from the many responsibilities in her life. This leads to her procrastinating or getting distracted when she has lots of looming deadlines coming up.

**APTITUDES:** Beyoncé is a great communicator, leader and planner. She's persistent and tries her best, no matter how big the challenge. A people person, she likes to help others.

**WEAKNESSES:** She cares a lot about how others perceive her, so when she's struggling she doesn't always want to ask for help in case she annoys her peers or they think she's incapable. She has a very busy schedule (her days are planned by the hour) so her priorities are usually centred around doing what's required for the assignment submission. She struggles to make time for additional learning or readings, and she needs advance notice of group meetings so she can fit it into her schedule.

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Beyoncé has not used a Study Organiser app before, she used multiple separate services to achieve the same thing.

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** Beyoncé is familiar with all of the functions of the Study Organiser app, having experienced them in separate platforms previously.

**INTERACTION:** Beyoncé will interact with the app to chat to peers and group members, organise and RSVP to group study sessions, and access other tools (calendar, project management tools) and resources for projects, like uploading or downloading files for the group (potentially multiple times a day).

**PRIORITIES:** She wants to receive updates and messages in real-time. She wants to be able to select meeting times that work for her by the hour to align with her busy schedule. She wants to be sure that none of the services provided by the app require access to her personal social media accounts.

**MOTIVATIONS:** Beyoncé wants to do well in her assignments and, because many of those are group projects, she uses the app as the best way to communicate and work with her group members.

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Beyoncé spends most of her day on a computer whether that's her laptop at uni or her PC at work, so she's very confident using the app. If the app changes she takes the time to learn the new interface so that she is never in a panic.

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Beyoncé has a high risk tolerance. She is happy to explore the functionalities of a system that she expects to be using frequently and has been told will improve the way she works. However, she does not like to install and learn to use a system that will only be required for one six-month course or one assignment.

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Beyoncé likes to absorb as much information as possible so that she is fully prepared and so that no problem is unexpected. She doesn't like to wait too long for information or answers.

**TINKERING: **Beyoncé doesn't generally have time to experiment with programs but will learn the parts that she needs.
