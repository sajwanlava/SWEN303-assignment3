## BACKGROUND
#### Introduction
The Student Study and Collaboration tool is a critical system which enables students to find an available time and place to problem solve together and connects individuals wanting to study for mutual courses. Peer learning is about people from similar social groupings learning together and from each other. The benefits from peer learning are clear and well-researched, and it is leading to more educational institutions including peer learning in their curriculums.
The application will provide an interface for students who already know each other, as well as an opportunity to meet other students interested in working on the same topics. There will be tools allowing students to communicate with one another and links to project management tools to ensure effective running of projects. Study groups are a good way to enact peer learning. At the moment, study groups and group project collaboration is organised using (primarily) social media. There is no one platform that allows communication between students working on the same course/topic, and finding a room and time to work together. The Study Organiser app would encourage peer learning in a centralised, easy-to-use platform by providing functionality to do all of these things and more.

The system will be a computer web application as opposed to a mobile application as operating it will be more efficient and clearer on a larger screen. If the application becomes popular and is successful there is always potential for an upgrade of the system which can
include a mobile version for added user convenience.

#### Existing Software
Existing software which incorporates the desired elements of the study application are Discord, the ECS forum and the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) Library study room booking system. Discord is primarily a tool for chatting between users on a specified channel. Many students use
Discord as a way to discuss, understand and reinforce class content. Ultimately, it is an anonymous means of chatting, but students can choose to organise study meetings during those discussions or via private message on the
platform. The ECS forum is used by engineering, computer science, and science students of Victoria University of Wellington to present questions to their tutors and lecturers. However, it has also been used to find partners for groups
projects and this process is overseen by staff. The VUW Library study room booking system is used by students looking to book spaces for collaborative group study. Typically, students use these room with their friends and peers they
already know.

While discord is a widely-used communication tool for students, it is not the most inclusive as servers are private channels and members can only be
added by invite. Accounts are often anonymous, and these are the reasons why there is a disconnect between students and finding study partners is
difficult.

![Discord](Final%20Report/Background/discord.png)

The following is the new library booking system. While this is easy to follow and aesthetically pleasing, there is a lack of a collaborative aspect to this tool with
no option of adding members to bookings. Subsequently, users may forget to inform study partners about a booking or study partners themselves could
forget as they are not directly associated with the booking.

![Library Booking](Final%20Report/Background/librarybooking.png)

The ECS forum has an overall outdated and dull design making it unappealing
to users which is most likely why not many students continue to use it. When a forum page gets filled it becomes inconvenient to click ‘next page’. It would be ideal to have an infinite scroll instead as some users may want to look at
forums from previous pages, and therefore there is no need to navigate
backwards.

![ECS Forum](Final%20Report/Background/forum.png)

From the analysis of these existing systems, it is seen that there is a need for a new study organiser tool which will be user-friendly and have effortless
functionality. The Good to Go system will aim to address the fact that there is no pre-existing software which combines the constructive elements and minimises the drawbacks of all the existing tools. Currently, users are having to
go to different areas in order to achieve tasks such as communicating with people and booking rooms for collaborative study. It makes sense to combine these functionalities into one tool which our study organiser will aim to
accomplish.

#### Business Objective
Each trimester is only 4 months long, but there is plenty of content to learn, and students need a way of asking questions and studying
effectively. The study organiser aims to increase efficiency in student learning and workflow as well as creating the opportunities for partnership in
study sessions in an appropriate and approved environment. Many courses have group projects and require collaboration, and all courses encourage use of a discussion forum of sorts to share ideas and answer each other's questions. should assist the students
and tutors on finding a room to study or work with projects and manage it.

The system should also be an easy, non-controversial way to reach tutors and academic staff. Facebook usually isn't appropriate for this, and email isn't as reliable. It should also be a way for tutors and academic staff to mitigate student interaction. The study organiser should support each user to see what available rooms there are to
book, cancel bookings, show a map, communicate with other users and let them meet new people. As this is mainly for the use of students, this application should not take up anything significant in terms of the cost of running a course
as lecturers, as employees, will not often have to use it.

#### Importance
A study organiser will be beneficial to many types of people at the university including; undergraduate, post-graduate, PhD students, tutors and academic staff. Coming from a multicultural city, there is expected to be a range of backgrounds our users have come from. Therefore, our personas
were chosen to emulate the diversity of possible users and were based around aspects of individuals we had come into contact with during our personal university experiences. The system will be providing the opportunity to bring together those wishing to actively improve their learning by seeking help with
others also wanting to learn and share their knowledge collaboratively. Furthermore, there are many merits about group study, such as enhancing
students’ interest in learning and exploring knowledges and improving students’ ability of teamwork and social skills. Also students can develop friendships in university as its key to maintain a social life to continue to be mentally healthy. Users will get the chance to meet new people as well as improve their time management and study organisation. 

For tutors and academic staff, this application will be used to oversee the activity of students to note whether the communication is occurring politely, to monitor any plagiarism, student questions, attend or facilitate study groups, and provide helpful resources such as links to project management tools. 

As this program will be used as a Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) application, the university are key stakeholders of it. The univerisity would need this to run well as it is a tool to support students and academic staff succeed in their work-life. 
 <br>

## PERSONAS
Our 6 personas were chosen with a focus on covering the range of unique potential users of our study organizer application. We considered the many different aspects of our users, which is evident within our personas, including: age, gender, roles, backgrounds, motivations etc. 
We were able to combine existing personas from different members’ previous assignments for this project as together they provided the persona coverage we were aiming for. Our study organizer will have different functionality for lecturers and tutors compared to students as a reflection of their different intentions and goals for the application. 


#### Domestic Student 1

*AROHA DAVIS (BY PRIYAL PATEL)*<br>
Aroha is in her first year at Victoria University of Wellington starting towards a Bachelor of Biomedical science majoring in Human Genetics. She is enrolled in COMP102 in the first trimester however
is struggling to cope with course content as it is all very new to her. Subsequently she is not achieving in her assessments and is stressed as she is taking COMP102 to satisfy a mandatory major requirement. The stress makes Aroha
feel insecure about being at University. Her academic goals

**ACTIVITIES:** Aroha enjoys watching and occasionally playing football, going for walks and watching movies.

**ATTITUDES:** She is an extroverted and bubbly person who loves spending time having fun with friends and family.

**APTITUDES:** She is naturally a healthy and fit person.

**WEAKNESSES:** She is a slow learner who gets overwhelmed easily. She can also be lazy and leaves things to the last minute. 

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Aroha is new to university and has come from a highschool which is very small and everyone knows each other. Therefore, she has not had much experience with the university systems and a study organiser app.

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** Aroha is familiar with using a computer, comfortable with majority of online systems and has experience using Microsoft Software but is struggling to remember and understand the numerous new shortcuts and functionalities needed to do her coding assignments, and the univerisity systems.

**INTERACTION:** Initially as Aroha is not very motivated, the Study Organiser app would be neglected. But as she becomes panicky about passing her requirements for her degree, she would use it a few times a week to help her get the extra help she requires by finding study buddies for setting up study groups with or finding scheduled study groups to attend.

**PRIORITIES:** Aroha will use this to find a study partner who will be a bit more onto it than she is, and hopefully is kind enough to support her learning. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** Aroha is very energetic and passionate when it comes to any outdoor activities but when it comes to school, she just wants to pass her mandatory requirements and find motivation to do work. 

**COMPUTER SELF EFFICACY:** She can’t perform many tasks on unfamiliar systems.

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Comfortable using systems that she is experienced with, but with new ones she gives up and therefore, she has a low risk tolerance.

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Takes a couple reviews and practice for her to learn information and someone, usually a friend, has to push her to do it.

#### International Student 

*RAHUL MEHTA (BY LAVANYA SAJWAN)*<br>
Rahul is a 34-year-old International Master of Engineering by Thesis student. He has recently moved from India and has not studied in a few years, so it is a bit strange for him to be back at a university. He has been working as a developer in private companies since graduating. Rahul is talkative and is often wanting to immerse himself in new experiences, especially in a new country. He has come here on a scholarship and has moved his wife and child overseas with him. 

Rahul uses the system to become better acquainted with other students and in doing so help familiarise himself with the local terminology and accents.

**ACTIVITIES:** Rahul is still setting up his new rental property and exploring Wellington’s sights with his new family.  

**ATTITUDES:** Rahul is an extremely optimistic individual. He is outgoing and is always willing to learn.  

**APTITUDES:** Rahul is extremely hard working. His drive comes from moving his family halfway across the world so he could further his education despite being considered “well-off” overseas.  

**WEAKNESSES:** While he is fluent in speaking three languages; Punjabi, Hindi and English, he finds it difficult to understand colloquial words and jargon present in the English language, and more notably in the kiwi way of speaking.  

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Rahul has had some experience in the use of a similar system to the study organiser in his old jobs as a way of connecting with people in the workplace and booking rooms for meetings.  

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** At university, he has used Discord, the ECS forum and the library booking system, but not a lot as he is still new. He has not used a system where elements of each are all combined to make our designed product.  

**INTERACTION:** Rahul will often be using the system. He is new and needs to do bridging courses to complete his masters and would really like to meet people in those papers so that he can find study buddies. 

**PRIORITIES:** Rahul wants to easily connect with like-minded people in his courses and book meeting rooms for study sessions. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** Rahul wants to do the best he can in his courses and complete his Masters thesis to the best standard possible.   

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Rahul has been working in the technology sphere since graduation and considers himself a competent user of systems. Coming from a coding background, he does not enjoy badly designed interfaces.  

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Rahul has a medium risk tolerance. He understands that developing a product is hard, but if something has been deployed, it should be expected to work properly. 

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Rahul is more comfortable with theory-based learning, but after an explanation of a system, he would not mind playing around with it. 

**TINKERING:** Rahul does not mind tinkering with a program. He is an inquisitive person so when he gets the initial explanation on how to use something, he will keep on trying every scenario till he reaches all outcomes.  


#### Domestic Student 2

*BEYONCE (BY ALEISHA AMOHIA)*
<br>Beyoncé is a 21 year old student at Victoria University of Wellington, living in the CBD. She is in a Computer Science Major in her third year. Most of her engineering and computer science courses include group assignments so she uses the Study Organiser app talk to her classmates and find rooms and times to meet with group members.
Her goal is to obtain a B+ average grade across all of her courses. She wants to do well, but she has many other responsibilities and activities to juggle and finds that she struggles to learn the content as quickly as some of her peers. She often uses the app to ask questions about assignments, which usually get answered by a fellow student or tutor.
She likes that she has access to her peers and academic support without them seeing unrelated person content such as her Facebook or Instagram posts. Being a woman in a male-dominated area, she appreciates having a platform away from social media with a university-only context because it sets a standard and expectation of how to interact with each other.

**ACTIVITIES:** Beyoncé spends most of her days at uni in classes or in the library, and if she's not at uni then she's at work. She works part-time at a tech start-up based in the city as a Junior Developer. She doesn't like to do assignments in the evenings because she's normally quite drained by the end of the day, so she likes to relax by watching Netflix or having a drink with friends. Beyoncé also teaches a code club once a week at her primary school.

**ATTITUDES:** Being the busy person that she is, Beyoncé is highly organised. However she is also often stressed and feels a lot of pressure from the many responsibilities in her life. This leads to her procrastinating or getting distracted when she has lots of looming deadlines coming up.

**APTITUDES:** Beyoncé is a great communicator, leader and planner. She's persistent and tries her best, no matter how big the challenge. A people person, she likes to help others.

**WEAKNESSES:** She cares a lot about how others perceive her, so when she's struggling she doesn't always want to ask for help in case she annoys her peers or they think she's incapable. She has a very busy schedule (her days are planned by the hour) so her priorities are usually centred around doing what's required for the assignment submission. She struggles to make time for additional learning or readings, and she needs advance notice of group meetings so she can fit it into her schedule.

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Beyoncé has not used a Study Organiser app before, she used multiple separate services to achieve the same thing.

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** Beyoncé is familiar with all of the functions of the Study Organiser app, having experienced them in separate platforms previously.

**INTERACTION:** Beyoncé will interact with the app to chat to peers and group members, organise and RSVP to group study sessions, and access other tools (calendar, project management tools) and resources for projects, like uploading or downloading files for the group (potentially multiple times a day).

**PRIORITIES:** She wants to receive updates and messages in real-time. She wants to be able to select meeting times that work for her by the hour to align with her busy schedule. She wants to be sure that none of the services provided by the app require access to her personal social media accounts.

**MOTIVATIONS:** Beyoncé wants to do well in her assignments and, because many of those are group projects, she uses the app as the best way to communicate and work with her group members.

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Beyoncé spends most of her day on a computer whether that's her laptop at uni or her PC at work, so she's very confident using the app. If the app changes she takes the time to learn the new interface so that she is never in a panic.

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Beyoncé has a high risk tolerance. She is happy to explore the functionalities of a system that she expects to be using frequently and has been told will improve the way she works. However, she does not like to install and learn to use a system that will only be required for one six-month course or one assignment.

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Beyoncé likes to absorb as much information as possible so that she is fully prepared and so that no problem is unexpected. She doesn't like to wait too long for information or answers.

**TINKERING:** Beyoncé doesn't generally have time to experiment with programs but will learn the parts that she needs.

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** He is proficient in modern technology use therefore can use nearly all systems without any major trouble. 

**INTERACTION:** He would most likely want to maintain daily interaction with the Study Organiser to check on any of his students’ course related activity as he wants to use the system to ensure his students can progress with their work and aren’t delayed in doing so. However active interaction would probably be a couple times a week used to arrange extra study sessions when additional help is needed.  

**PRIORITIES:** Austin will strive to be there for his students in providing them with answers to the questions they have and providing further information when they encounter difficulties. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** He hopes his passion for design along with the opportunity to tutor first years will boost his confidence and improve his social skills. 

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Austin is an independent person who can perform tasks with limited aid from others. 

**RISK TOLERANCE:** This ability to process information quickly gives him confidence with operating new systems as well as allowing himself to adapt to new environments and easily overcome technical obstacles either on his own, by looking up solutions online or asking one of his friends.  

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** He is a fast learner.

#### Lecturer 

*PROFESSOR FAN YU HONG (BY LAVANYA SAJWAN)*
<br>Fan Yu Hong is a 57-year-old Financial Econometrics lecturer at the VUW Pipitea campus. Outside of her time teaching students, she is a divorced mother of two and likes to spend much time with her children. While she does teach a technical course, she would prefer to use a simple system. As a career and family orientated woman, she would rather her spare time is spent enjoying hobbies. Yu Hong is a person who looks at models and graphs often, so she values an interface that is simple and aesthetic. 

**ACTIVITIES:** Yu Hong spends a lot of time with her kids. In her weeks without them, she enjoys going on long walks and meeting friends for brunch. 

**ATTITUDES:** Fan Yu Hong is a straightforward and blunt individual. However, she always tries to support her students.  

**APTITUDES:** Fan Yu Hong is intelligent and well spoken. She is seen as a good lecturer.  

**WEAKNESSES:** She can be impatient. 

**DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE:** Prof. Yu Hong has only ever taught at Victoria University. She has been teaching at Victoria University for four years now and has used existing systems, but they are only used in this university so she does not have knowledge on other systems which may be specific to other universities.  

**SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:** The organisation tools she has used have been the room booking systems. She has not used Discord or the ECS forum as they are both more specific for the ECS faculty. Therefore, she does not have a lot of knowledge about the combination study organisation system that we have designed.  

**INTERACTION:** Yu Hong will interact with the study organisation application most often closer to exams or tests when students want extra help sessions. She will also assign tutors for the course that she is lecturing at the beginning of each trimester.

**PRIORITIES:** Fan Yu Hong wants to be certain that students are using this medium of communication wisely, as well as ascertain what they might be confused about in the class content. She also would like to easily book rooms for small help sessions. 

**MOTIVATIONS:** Her only motivation is that it will be easier to book rooms for groups of people that are interested in help sessions.  

**COMPUTER SELF-EFFICACY:** Fan Yu Hong is competent learning new tasks and how to use new systems, but it has to be a quick process otherwise she ignores it till it becomes absolutely necessary to use. 

**RISK TOLERANCE:** Yu Hong has an extremely low risk tolerance - preferring to use systems and features that are tested and fully work, otherwise she gives up. 

**INFORMATION PROCESSING:** Yu Hong likes to absorb information that is relevant to her own learning. She feels that she does not have time for supplementary learning. 

**TINKERING:** Yu Hong does not like tinkering on programs. She would rather use something that is easy and functional as that does not require much learning.  


## USE CASES
Scenarios were decided during the evaluation phase of everyone assignments. We picked traits from each we liked, and combined them to make a hybrid prototype with all those positive and helpful functionalities. The aim then was to make the scenarios based of those traits and that they were valid for the program.

## GROUP REFLECTION
After user testing the prototype, we came up with a list of issues. These were rated using severity levels and listed in the Usability Test Report. Therefore, when reworking our prototype based on the feedback, the emphasis of completion was put upon those with severity level 1 and 2.

While generating the user testing report, we left out the feedback on the colours and suggestion to use curves more on our prototype as we felt that this was subjective to the user and our team did appreciate the design we had chosen. The primary two colours were blue and green. Blue was chosen as it is a calming colour for a user (as discussed in lectures), and the green as to try to associate this as a VUW program still. We chose to have straight lines rather than curved as while curved boxes draw attention to the text; we instead designed our web interface to have succinct containers holding specific information, for example, the header. Due to this, we believed there needed to be a definite distinction between each part, and this was done with the use of hard corners and straight lines.

In the final prototype, another thing we left out was when the chats were expanded to become full-screen chat interface; it was unable to be shrunk down from the full page back to the pop-up. This was more to do with an Adobe XD feature, as it does not let overlays go back to their last state; instead, it resets the page completely.

Another thing we also left out was connecting the lecturer monitor page (which had a function to add tutors) and the tutor monitor page. This was because those actions are for a small group of people, and if we wanted to add it in, we would have to build identical prototype applications around them. As our final prototype is for our primary stakeholders - students, we spent most of our time perfecting the main prototype, and we also did not implement an interaction for tutors and lecturers to search for available chats associated with the courses they teach in.  Due to this we also did not implement a specific view for tutors and lecturers to be able to read reported messages, as we thought that this would be incorporated in the monitor chat anyway. The monitor pages and add tutor interaction is submitted with our final, to show that we have talked about it and will be added to our video to show how the interactions work. 

We did not implement showing scroll bars on the prototype as that issue was rated a low severity and in actuality, many users use laptops which do not even show a scroll bar anymore; nameably Apple Macs. Another low severity issue we did not do was the group chat to be of higher precedence than the other chats as one of our testers suggested. This was because we decided that it would be more intuitive for messages to be listed in chronological order. 

With discussions with the team, we decided that the best characteristic of our prototype was that it was a true combination of everyone's previous prototypes from assignment 2. This was in part due to our evaluations of each prototype, but also that we spent an entire meeting discussing what functionalities and aesthetics we liked from the initial prototypes and what we would bring forward. Developing regularly occurred internally as the team was comfortable enough with each other to state their dislikes and contribute feedback on each other's design choices. That being said, what we also did well was designing based on the usability test. We took the feedback seriously and immediately took to reworking our prototype based on it. Subsequently, our design is natural and familiar to use.

Our final prototype does not take in any user inputs and this was something we could have improved with our prototype. Therefore, we can not anticipate whether users will like how the prototype processes it. Due to the lack of this user input, we cannot test adding a calendar or room booking either. While we were prompt in implementing the user feedback changes, we did not usability test our final prototype again. While this was not a necessity, to do well in this project, we feel as though it would have bettered our prototype overall, as it would give us a conclusive answer as to whether or not our prototype was the best it could be.
